For instance, instead of running our calculations on a normal CPU, as we've done above, we could do thousands of them simultaneously by taking advantage of a GPU. We could greatly reduce the amount of computation and data needed by using a convolution instead of a matrix multiplication, which basically means skipping over a bunch of the multiplications and additions for bits that you'd guess won't be important. We could make things much faster if, instead of starting with random parameters, we start with parameters of someone else's model that does something similar to what we want (this is called *transfer learning*).\n",
